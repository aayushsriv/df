            He had three simple rules by which he lived. The first was to never eat blue food. There was nothing in
            nature
            that was
            edible that was blue. People often asked about blueberries, but everyone knows those are actually purple. He
            understood
            it was one of the stranger rules to live by, but it had served him well thus far in the 50+ years of his
            life.
            She looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen. She tried to think back to when the girl had
            been
            younger
            but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry. It hit
            her
            all at
            once. She was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear, sadness, and pride all
            running
            through
            her at the same time.
            He sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction. She sat
            staring ahead,
            never noticing that she was being watched. Both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or
            in
            another
            universe, they had been happy together.
